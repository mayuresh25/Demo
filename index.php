    <p>Taj Mahal tops the list of Seven Wonders of the World.The White marble mausoleum is located in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, which is only 200 Km from New Delhi, the capital of India.
        It was built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
        The Taj Mahal is widely recognized as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage"
        Around 20,000 people worked day and night for twenty two years to complete construction of the Taj Mahal.
        The Taj Mahal was constructed using the best quality marble from Rajasthan, Tibet, Afghanistan and China.
        At different times of the day the Taj Mahal appears to be in a different colour. Some believe that these changing colours depict the changing moods of a woman. </p>

<p>This 13th century Sun Temple of Konark, Odisha is an architectural marvel as it is considered one of the grandest temples of India. Although the main structure of the temple has been collapsed around 150 years ago, yet the surviving structure represents the full glory.
    It is believed that the temple was built by king Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga Dynasty around AD 1250.
    It resembles a colossal chariot, with 24 wheels, pulled by seven straining horses, and has a three-tiered pyramidal roof topped off by a fine spire.
    The Sun - God's chariot, also represents the seven days of the week, and the 24 hours of the day, in its concept.
    The temple is a brilliant chronicle in stone, with impressive sculptures.
    Every aspect of life is represented here, and the erotic imagery, depicts the sublimation of human love manifested in countless forms.
    Scenes from court, civic life and war are also done with great precision.</p></div>
